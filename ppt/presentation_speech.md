Here is a suggested script for your presentation. Feel free to adapt the tone to your natural speaking style.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening] everyone. Today, I am excited to present **Career Navigator AI**. This is a project designed to solve a very personal problem for many of us: how to effectively navigate our professional journeys using intelligent, data-driven guidance. My name is [Your Name], and I’ll be walking you through what we’ve built."

---

## Slide 2: Problem Statement
"Let's start with the problem. We've all been there—or know someone who has. The career landscape is confusing. Students often ask, 'What skills do I *actually* need to get hired?'
There is a massive gap between the skills candidates *think* they have and what the industry demands.
On top of that, preparing for interviews is often done in a vacuum, without realistic feedback. Most online advice is static and generic—it doesn't know *you*. We wanted to change that."

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
"Our solution is **Career Navigator AI**. Think of it as an intelligent, all-in-one platform that acts as your personal, 24/7 career coach.
It doesn't just give advice; it actively works with you.
It **analyzes** where you stand today by reading your resume.
It **guides** your future steps with personalized learning roadmaps.
And finally, it **prepares** you for the big day with realistic mock interviews. It covers the entire lifecycle of career preparation."

## Slide 4: Key Features Overview
"The platform is built around four core features:
1.  **AI-Powered Resume Analysis:** This isn't just a keyword match. It deep-scans your resume to score it and finding critical skill gaps.
2.  **Interactive Career Guidance:** If you want to become data scientist, it generates a step-by-step roadmap tailored for that role.
3.  **Smart Mock Interviewer:** We have an AI agent that acts as a strict interviewer, conducting realistic technical sessions.
4.  **Skill Validation:** You can take AI-generated quizzes on specific topics to prove to yourself that you've actually mastered the material."

## Slide 5: System Architecture
"Under the hood, we've built a robust, modern architecture.
On the **Frontend**, we use **React with TypeScript and Vite** for a fast, responsive, and type-safe user experience. Styling is handled by **Tailwind CSS**.
The **Backend** is powered by **FastAPI**, which is incredibly fast and perfect for AI applications.
For the **AI Engine**, we are leveraging **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash** model, orchestrated using **LangChain and LangGraph** to verify complex logic flows.
We use **SQLite** for a lightweight, reliable database solution."

## Slide 6: Deep Dive - Resume Analysis Agent
"Let's look closer at the Resume Analysis Agent.
When a user uploads a PDF, the system first cleans the text. Then, we use a multi-agent system built with **LangGraph**.
**Agent 1** acts as an extractor, pulling out structured data like skills and education.
**Agent 2** acts as a Senior Counselor. It identifies your professional domain, compares you against industry standards, and assigns a completion score from 0 to 100.
The output? Actionable advice on exactly what courses you need to take to close those gaps."

---

## Slide 7: Deep Dive - Career Guidance & Learning
"Next is Career Guidance.
Users simply input a target role, like 'DevOps Engineer'. The AI generates a structured, week-by-week timeline—starting from basics to advanced concepts.
But it's not just a list. It's interactive. You can click on any topic to get an instant, detailed explanation generated by the AI.
And to ensure you aren't just reading but *learning*, we have a **Quiz Mode** where the AI generates dynamic questions to test your understanding of that specific topic."

---

## Slide 8: Deep Dive - AI Mock Interviewer
"Perhaps our most exciting feature is the Mock Interviewer.
The user selects a role, and the AI takes on the persona of a Senior Interviewer.
It's not just pre-scripted questions. The AI uses **conversational memory** to ask follow-up questions based on your previous answers. It mixes Technical, Behavioral, and Situational questions.
After you answer, it gives you constructive feedback—telling you what you got right, and how you could have phrased it better."

---

## Slide 9: Future Enhancements
"We have a clear roadmap for the future.
We plan to add **Voice Integration**, so you can speak to the interviewer instead of typing.
We want to integrate **Live Job Market Data** to match you with real open positions.
We also envision **Community Features** for peer reviews, and an **AI-Assisted Resume Builder** to help you write your resume from scratch using our data insights."

## Slide 10: Conclusion
"In conclusion, **Career Navigator AI** is more than just a tool. It bridges the gap between ambition and achievement. It makes career planning **Personalized, Intelligent, and Actionable**.

Thank you for your time. I'd be happy to answer any questions."
